  <h1>Clayton King: SpaceX Mission Control</h1>

  <article>
    As everybody in the United States was watching the livestream of the Crew Dragon Demo-2 Mission (DM-2), behind
    the scenes was ACE’s very own alumni Clayton King ‘15 hard at work! “My role in the DM-2 mission was supporting
    the CRONUS console, from Mission Control Center in Houston, as a flight controller for the International Space
    Station. I was on console for the shifts after the launch and after the docking. The CRONUS console supports the
    command, data handling, communication, and tracking systems for the ISS. Ahead of the mission, I worked closely
    with our DM-2 team to develop several audio procedures for voice between DM-2 and ISS.” Congratulations Clayton
    on a successful mission and all the best for what lies ahead!
