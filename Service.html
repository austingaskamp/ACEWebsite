        Camp Hope is a foundation that connects combat veterans with the resources they need to transition
        back to civilian life. Located in Houston, Camp Hope offers veterans with a range of services from
        temporary housing to support sessions with trauma mentors. At ACE, we understand and value the
        sacrifices our veterans have made to provide us the freedom to learn & live at A&M. With that in
        mind, our goal is to give back to our veterans by partnering with Camp Hope.

      <p>ACE partnered with the Boys & Girls Club of Brazos Valley last spring, and we are looking forward to working
        with this great organization again this year! As engineers, we have the unique opportunity to expose the children
        of the Boys & Girls Club to STEM ideas and principles and a very young age - working to build the next generation
        of engineers, computer scientists, entrepreneurs, and much more. Through our work with the youth of Brazos Valley,
        we are hoping to make both a personal and educational impact.</p>
